A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Specifically we will see:

- Asset management
- Packages
- Packages
- Gesture Detector
- Widget positioning
- Mappers
- Gradients
- Loops
- Assertions
- Stacks
- Video controllers
- Much more




This section is part of the course thanks to the feedback from several people who participated in the DevTalles live class in which I exposed this application and recommended adding it to the course :)

But at the same time, I decided to go the extra mile and do the exercise that will help us later to learn two new concepts that we will see in the next section which are repositories and datasources.

## Importante:
Los videos no están incluídos en el repositorio, debido a que son muy pesados y GitHub no lo permite.

Pueden descargar 8 videos de aquí: [Pexels Free Videos](https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/vertical/)

Renombren esos videos así, ya que es lo que se encuentra en nuestro data source.
